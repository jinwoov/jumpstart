## Overview

Jumpstart is a mobile-friendly, responsive web app that enables users to search for job postings in their local area. Users can search by location and job title / keyword. Users can also save their favorite postings, mark which postings they've already applied for, and also mark postings that they wouldn't like to see any more.
